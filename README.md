# Classification Tasks Using DNN and SVM

Classification tasks were implemented using both Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on a phoneme classification dataset from a public course by National Taiwan University. The dataset includes 39 phoneme classes representing different English pronunciations, with corresponding data for classification tasks. The dataset can be accessed at the following URL: [Dataset URL](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HPkcmQmFGu-3knddKIa5dNDSR05LIQR)。

## Dataset Description
- **Train_11.npy**: Unlabeled data.
- **Train_label_11.npy**: Corresponding labels.

This work was conducted as part of an experimental project during my master’s studies. The accompanying report documents the experiment. If you find it useful, your support by giving it a star would be greatly appreciated.
